# Beetrip Challenge

MARTIN CONNOR SEXTON

## Description

### Summary 
- I completed the various steps of the challenge as outlined in the original instructions (https://weepulse.notion.site/Test-d-veloppeur-FullStack-d663add887a643af80c94cc67b34274f).

- I created a repository on Github for the project: https://github.com/ConCapbreton/Beetrip 

- The repository contains three folders: 

#### DB: 
- Here you will find the ER diagram in pdf format in response to the DB challenge (file name: 'Task Management Software - Database ER Diagram').

- You can also view the ER diagram on Lucid Chart at this link: https://lucid.app/lucidchart/b9ed4d73-7477-414a-b8cb-0429b7e4bbd1/edit?viewport_loc=-2834%2C-600%2C2483%2C1185%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_517ae4ad-fc43-471c-8060-99948717e24b
     
### Integration
- Here you will find the index.html and styles.css files should you wish to see the code for the Integration challenge

- I hosted the project online at https://beetrip-integration.netlify.app/ 

### Code
- Here you will find the front and back folders should you wish to see the code for the Code challenge

- I have hosted both the frontend and the backend online. You can access the frontend site at https://letsplaytennis.netlify.app/  (the backend is hosted on render)

- If you wish to run the "Code" project on your computer you will need to:

- Clone the Git repository into your IDE or download the zip folder of the project and open the extracted folder in your IDE.

Backend: 
- Open the terminal, navigate to './Code/back' 
- Install dependencies
  ```bash
  npm install 
  ```
- Start the app
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- Either deploy your frontend on port 5500 or add your frontend's localhost address to the corsOptions variable (line 7 of ./Code/back/server.js).

Frontend: 
- Open the `./Code/front/index.html` file in your web browser (either on port 5500 or having updated the backend code as per the instruction above.

- update the fetch on the frontend with your locally hosted server's url (line 91 of ./Code/font/index.js).

### Technologies
- For the frontend challenges I used vanilla html/css/javascript. 

- For the backend I used node.js with express and cors as dependencies (and nodemon as a dev dependency).

- For the DB challenge I used Lucid Charts to create the ER Diagram

Note: I used vanilla html/css/javascript on the frontend as this was allowed as per the instructions (and these technoligies were fine to complete the challenges). In the description of the stage on Indeed it is mentioned that React and Typescript are required. If it is preferable I would be happy to convert the projects to React using Typescript (I have completed several projects using React with Typescript already that you can access at my site: https://martinconnorsexton.netlify.app/)
